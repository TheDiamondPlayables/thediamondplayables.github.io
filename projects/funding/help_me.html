  <p>Look, I have to be real with ya for a bit. <b>I need your help</b>.
  <br>I've been making this stuff <b>since 2018</b>, and I try my best to make the best projects I can in each update. But I hate that <span>everything in life needs money</span>. Because of that, I have to <span>spend time away</span> on a job in order to cover the costs for this, which also means <span>less time to spend</span> on it each day.</p>

  <p>I just want to have more time to <b>spend on making fun things</b> for you guys.
  <br>And I'll need your help to make this work:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>You can help me out <span>a bit each month</span> <a href="https://www.patreon.com/thediamondplayables">here</a>.</li>
   <ul>
    <li>You'll also <span>get secret stuff</span> each month!</li>
   </ul>
   <li>That or you can buy me <a href="https://paypal.me/thediamondplayables">a one-time coffee</a> here.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This <b>helps cover my living costs</b> so I can do this more often. Thanks!</p>

    <p>If you can't help me with money, you can <b>help me with words</b>.
    <br>Let me know your thoughts, leave a good review, and share them with everyone.</p>
    <p>If more people know about what I do, some of them will have the money to support me.
    <br>In the end, <b>I just want to be able to do this more often</b>.
    <br>If I can, that means more packs and updates for you, sent out more often!</p>

    <p>Thank you for using my projects and for reading this. You're the best!
    <br>I've spent way too long editing this section. Let's move on ...</p>
