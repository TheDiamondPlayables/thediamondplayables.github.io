<p>CropBooster makes <b>Composters boost surrounding crops</b> with its Compost!
<br>This is <b>an optional Composter upgrade</b> that doesn't affect the vanilla Composter.</p>
<p>This means you can:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Upgrade the Composter to make it boost crops around itself,</li>
 <li>Or keep the Composter if you only need its vanilla use.</li>
</ul>
<p>The CropBooster also supports hopper feeding for more automation, too!</p>

<blockquote>The Composter could've been way much better ...</blockquote>
