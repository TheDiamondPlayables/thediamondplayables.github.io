<h1>Changes:</h1>
<ul>
 <li>Is now designed for Minecraft 1.21.5!</li>
 <li><b>CropBooster now supports Cactus Flowers!</b></li>
 <ul>
  <li>They grow pretty much like how you'd expect them to in Vanilla, with a bit higher chance to grow.</li>
  <li>Emulating this one accurately took me a while, but it works and runs pretty smoothly, so it's worth it.</li>
 </ul>
 <li>CropBoosters <span>no longer detach attached blocks</span> when a boost level is lost.</li>
 <ul>
  <li>This should be obvious behavior, but it can't be realistically done before 1.21.5.</li>
 </ul>
 <li>Updated advancement background to match game update's general theme.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Admin Settings changes:</h1>
<ul>
 <li><b>New Settings</b>: Small/Medium/Tall Flower chance</li>
 <ul>
  <li>Chance for a boosted Cactus to grow a Flower when it's 1/2/3 blocks tall respectively.</li>
 </ul>
 <li>Moved Cactus's Growth Rate alongsides the Flower chance settings to its own Cactus Growth Settings page.</li>
 <li><span>Reordered existing settings</span> to keep the consistent look between pages.</li>
 <li>Built-in presets have also been updated to support these new settings.</li>
 <ul>
  <li>Presets made in previous builds will still work - it just assumes the new settings are unchanged.</li>
 </ul> 
</ul>
<p>Note: If the dates look off, it's because the official release went live that day without the IHF file improvements. I'm still counting it as it being released by then for simplicity sakes.</p>
