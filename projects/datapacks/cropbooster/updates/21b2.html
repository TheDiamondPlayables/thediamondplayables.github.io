<h1>Changes:</h1>
<ul>
 <li>Fixed a major issue causing CropBooster's save preset feature to not work.</li>
 <ul>
  <li>You'll have to update to this version in order to save your presets for use in other worlds.</li>
 </ul>
 <li>Boosts will no longer be given to Cactus/Sugarcane if it can't grow upwards.</li>
 <ul>
  <li>Prior to this, boosts will still be given to these crops because they can still grow in place before growing upwards. But you can't help something grow up if they can't grow up in the first place, so this has ultimately been reverted.</li>
 </ul>
 <li>Improved performance when boosting Cactus/Sugarcane.</li>
 <ul>
  <li>It's a small improvement, but it helps if you have a lot of these loaded at a time.</li>
 </ul>
</ul>
<p>Note: If the dates look off, it's because the official release went live that day without the IHF file improvements. I'm still counting it as it being released by then for simplicity sakes.</p>
