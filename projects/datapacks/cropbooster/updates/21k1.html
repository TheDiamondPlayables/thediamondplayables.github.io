<p>After a while of having to deal with landmines that came with Mounts of Mayhem, the Datapack Series are finally here for the last game drop of 2025!</p>

<h1>Changes:</h1>
<ul>
 <li>Is now designed for Minecraft 1.21.11!</li>
 <li><b>Admin Books have been removed</b> and replaced with the Admin Settings menu.</li>
 <ul>
  <li>The Admin Settings menu lets you <span>tweak all settings in one go, and apply them all at once</span>!</li>
  <li>Accessing this menu <span>is the same as getting the Admin Book</span>, so it should be easy to get used to it.</li>
 </ul>
 <li>New Presets Menu:</li>
 <ul>
  <li>This lets you <span>view and edit a Custom Preset's values</span> before applying them!</li>
  <li>Triggers each time you load a <span>Custom Preset</span>.</li>
 </ul>
 <li>New Show Configs Menu:</li>
 <ul>
  <li>This lets all players read Admin Setting values in detail!</li>
  <li>Access by running <code>/trigger tdp.readconfigs</code>.</li>
  <li>Players will be notified on how to access this menu each time the Settings were changed.</li>
 </ul>
 <li>The player who made changes to packs' Admin Commands are no longer announced in-game.</li>
 <ul>
  <li>Mainly because that job is meant for the server consoles, and that information doesn't help with the players' gameplay experience anyway.</li>
 </ul>
 <li>Tweaked the names, descriptions of all CropBooster's setting buttons to better match the interface it's now in.</li>
 <li>IHF files now have their descriptions updated to reflect the recent set of changes.</li>
 <li>Updated advancement background to match game update's theme.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Update notes:</h1>
<ul>
 <li>Because the underlying system has to be reworked to support Admin Settings, <b>your settings will be reset</b> when you update to this version.</li>
 <li>Don't worry though, <span>you can bring your settings back instantly</span> by loading a preset saved in the previous version, so be sure to do that before updating!</li>
</ul>

<h2>Dev comments:</h2>
<ul>
 <li>If you're wondering why I'm dropping the Admin Books now: <b>Mojang secretly obliterated a hidden mechanic</b> that I used to make Admin Books feel nice to use, this was on top of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250701223507/https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-java-edition-1-21-6#:~:text=Users%20will%20now%20be%20prompted%20for%20confirmation%20before%20executing%20a%20command%20from%20the%20run_command%20click%20action%20in%20books%20and%20chat%20if%20the%20command%20can%27t%20be%20parsed%20or%20requires%20elevated%20permissions%20(i.e.%2C%20higher%20than%200)">the forced confirmation screen</a> they added in 1.21.6.</li>
 <ul>
  <li>Even if it's a bug that'll eventually be fixed, <span>the damage has already been done</span>, and I had to deal with it if I want to properly update all my packs to this release.</li>
  <li>The reality is, adding new tools to make stuff with proper care just takes this long, and I have to make sure that the tool I'd built won't cause pack clashes when it's used on my other packs that were also running on Book Binder.</li>
 </ul>
