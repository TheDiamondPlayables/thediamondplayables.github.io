<h1>Changes:</h1>
<ul>
 <li>Added support for Torchflower and Pitcher Pod.</li>
 <ul>
  <li>Both have a high growth rate when boosted by a Composter.</li>
  <li>Might as well make these crops a bit less underwhelming, I guess.</li>
 </ul>
 <li>The 1.18x upgrade function is now <code>upgrade_20</code>.</li>
 <ul>
  <li>1.19x CropBoosters work just fine and doesn't need an upgrade.</li>
  <li>This is just for those who haven't updated since 1.18 yet.</li>
 </ul>
 <li>Fixed a response typo as you upgrade all existing CropBoosters to 1.20.</li>
 <li>Improved CropBooster's execution with 1.20's technical improvements.</li>
</ul>
