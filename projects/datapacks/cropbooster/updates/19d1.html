<h1>Important changes:</h1>
<ul>
 <li>Is now designed for Minecraft 1.19.4.</li>
 <ul>
  <li>It's not advised to run this in older versions, I won't be able to provide much support if you do.
  <br>(Imagine having to do that for all older versions for all my datapacks, you'll see a scale issue)</li>
 </ul>
</ul>
<h1>Gameplay changes:</h1>
<ul>
 <li>Only players who used the Bone Meal onto the Composter gets the "Boosting Season" advancement.</li>
 <ul>
  <li>Advancement progression is also reset for all players, and yes, the name has been changed.</li>
 </ul>
 <li>Increased the chance for Glow Berries to appear to 12% (from 10%)</li>
 <ul>
  <li>I've found that this feels more like vanilla after doing quite a few glow berry growth tests.
  <br>(It's actually closer to 11%, but Composter adds more nutrients to plants, so 12% is fine)</li>
 </ul>
</ul>
<h1><span class="tooltip"><span class="tooltipText">Just me polishing some stuff in the background.</span>Non-gameplay changes:</span></h1>
<ul>
 <li>Codebase now runs on Scripter 3.1.</li>
 <li>Optimized CropBooster's execution code.</li>
 <li>CropBooster creation effect is now a bit more visible.</li>
 <li><span>TheDiamondPlayables</span> is now colored in <span style="color: #00BBBB">dark aqua</span> by design. (grey-ish aqua?)</li>
 <ul>
  <li>The old design feels more vanilla, but it doesn't sit right with me.
  <br>Seeing a gray TheDiamondPlayables just feel ... off.</li>
 </ul>
</ul>
<h1>Notes:</h1>
<ul>
 <li>Experimental plants won't be supported by CropBooster, because this causes feature flag errors for those not playing in Experimental versions. You'll have to wait when it's officially released, I'll see what I can do when these plants are in official versions.</li>
 <li>CropBoosters activated before this update still works normally after the update.</li>
</ul>
