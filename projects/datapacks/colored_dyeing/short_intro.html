<p>Colored Dyeing <b>lets you redye colored blocks</b>!
<br>This saves you time gathering more colored blocks by reusing the excess amount of a different colored block you got lying around.</p>
<p>Works on all colorable blocks!</p>

<blockquote>Why get more if you can reuse what you already got?</blockquote>
