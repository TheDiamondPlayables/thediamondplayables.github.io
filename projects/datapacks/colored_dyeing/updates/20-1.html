<h1>Changes:</h1>
<ul>
 <li><b>Removed the redye recipes for Colored Wool, Carpets and Beds.</b></li>
 <ul>
  <li>These are now supported by Mojang, so having them is no longer necessary.</li>
  <li>This is probably the deepest they'll ever go with Colored Dyeing though, so I'm still maintaining it!</li>
 </ul>
 <li>Changed the Advancement Tab's background.</li>
</ul>
