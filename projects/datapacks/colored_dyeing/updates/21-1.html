<h1>Changes:</h1>
<ul> 
 <li>Is now designed for Minecraft 1.21 and 1.21.1!</li>
 <li>Concrete Powder can now be crafted <b>using equal parts of Sand/Gravel</b>, with the rest being other Concrete Powder!</li>
 <ul>
  <li>This most likely won't be used often, but might be useful in some scenarios.</li>
 </ul>
 <li>The original Concrete Powder redye recipe <b>is now </b><span tabindex=0 class=tooltip><span class=tooltipText>Any pattern would do, as long as you have the ingredients.</span><b>Shapeless</b></span>!</li>
 <ul>
  <li>This is actually a part of the rule mentioned above, just that it has 0 extra Sand/Gravel mixed in.</li>
  <li>Also because making Concrete Powder itself is shapeless, so it's a nod to that as well.</li>
 </ul>
 <li>All Crafting Table recipes can now be automated using the Crafter!</li>
</ul>
<h1>Extras:</h1>
<ul>
 <li><b>Added Admin Commands!</b> To use them:</li>
 <ul>
  <li>Simply type <code>/function tdp.</code> in chat, the game should give you suggestions on what to use.</li>
  <ul>
   <li><b>Side note:</b> Any command suggestions with underscores are <b>for internal use only</b> and won't work if run on their own.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Only those with the "Allow Commands" permission can use Admin Commands.</li>
 </ul>
 <li>A lot of filenames have been changed to properly organize everything.</li>
 <ul>
  <li>IDs have been removed and is now replaced by code names.</li>
  <li>The format is now <code>tdp:code_name/data</code>, to reserve the old names for Admin Commands.</li>
 </ul>
 <li>After 6 years of doing this (Colored Dyeing existed since 1.13), <b>we finally have icons now</b>!
 </li>
 <li>Improved the look of info text messages.</li>
 <li>Text files have been merged into one single Interactive Help File.</li>
 <ul>
  <li>I have to learn 3 new languages to get all this to work as well as it did. </li>
  <li>Not the best at it yet, but it works well enough for now.</li>
 </ul>
 <li>The master background has been updated for major releases as always.</li>
 <li>Codebase now uses Scripter 4.</li>
</ul>
