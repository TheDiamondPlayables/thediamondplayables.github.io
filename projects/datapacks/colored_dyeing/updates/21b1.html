<h1>Changes:</h1>
<ul>
 <li><span>Is now designed for Minecraft 1.21.2-1.21.3!</span></li>
 <li>Added a recipe to <span>clear Bundles' colors with a Water Bucket</span>!</li>
 <li>Undying a Candle no longer works if the Candle is already not dyed.</li>
 <li>Fixed a bug that stops you from undying Candles if gamerule <code>doLimitedCrafting</code> is on.</li>
 <ul>
  <li>This doesn't apply retroactively to old worlds though.</li>
  <li>If you're one of the rare ones who are affected by this, run <code>/advancement revoke @a only tdp:colored_dyeing/entry</code> to fix this issue.</li>
 </ul>
 <li>IHF files now load images online if it makes sense to do so, massively reducing filesizes.</li>
</ul>
