<p><b>Note</b>: Starting a small experiment to try and categorize the new stuff in each update log.</p>
<h1>Important changes:</h1>
<ul>
 <li>Is now designed for Minecraft 1.19.4.</li>
 <ul>
  <li>It's not advised to run this in older versions, I won't be able to provide much support if you do.
  <br>(Imagine having to do that for all older versions for all my datapacks, you'll see a scale issue)</li>
 </ul>
</ul>
<h1><span class="tooltip"><span class="tooltipText">Just me polishing some stuff in the background.</span>Non-gameplay changes:</span></h1>
<ul>
 <li>Codebase now runs on Scripter 3.1.</li>
 <li><b>Only 9/148 crafting recipes are shown to the user</b> upon Colored Dyeing's launch.</li>
 <ul> 
  <li>Or at least it should be, after Mojang's fixed <a href="https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-260148">MC-260148</a>.</li>
  <li>Each of these is a representative of how to redye/undye blocks like it, so you should still know how all the new recipes work.</li>
  <li>It's just designed this way to reduce the amount of recipes that you don't need to know to know how Colored Dyeing works.</li>
  <li>Shouldn't affect anyone who's already had Colored Dyeing installed.</li>
 </ul>
 <li><span>TheDiamondPlayables</span> is now colored in <span style="color: #00BBBB">dark aqua</span> by design. (grey-ish aqua?)</li>
 <ul>
  <li>The old design feels more vanilla, but it doesn't sit right with me.
  <br>Seeing a gray TheDiamondPlayables just feel ... off.</li>
 </ul>
</ul>
