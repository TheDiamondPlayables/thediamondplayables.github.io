<h1>Changes:</h1>
<ul>
 <li>Is now designed for Minecraft 1.19.3 and higher.</li>
 <ul>
  <li>It's not advised to run this in older versions, I won't be able to provide much support if you do.
  <br>(Imagine having to do that for all older versions for all my datapacks, you'll see a scale issue)</li>
 </ul>
 <li>Internal files have been renamed to adapt with the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221025032759/https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/9971900758413">new dot release changes from Mojang</a>.</li>
 <ul>
  <li>Updating from V19-1 to this version will cause the advancements to be reset for this to happen.</li>
 </ul>
</ul>
