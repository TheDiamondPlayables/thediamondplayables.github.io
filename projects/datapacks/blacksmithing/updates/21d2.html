<h1>Changes:</h1>
<ul>
 <li>Updated advancement background to match game update's theme.</li>
 <li>Fixed a small bug causing the full anvil recycling recipe to not show its toast notification when the pack is installed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: If the dates look off, it's because the official release went live that day without the IHF file improvements. I'm still counting it as it being released by then for simplicity sakes.</p>
