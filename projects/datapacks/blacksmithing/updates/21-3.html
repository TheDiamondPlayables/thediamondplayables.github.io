<h1>Changes:</h1>
<ul>
 <li>Blacksmithing now no longer creates an extra Anvil -> Iron recipe if Sawblade Recipes is also installed.</li>
 <li>Fixed a small bug causing the full recycle anvil recipe's toast notification to not show up.</li>
 <ul>
  <li>Technically none of the Recycle recipes need to be toasted (doLimitedCrafting doesn't affect em), but I get an itch if the toast doesn't include them.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: If the dates look off, it's because the official release went live that day without the IHF file improvements. I'm still counting it as it being released by then for simplicity sakes.</p>
