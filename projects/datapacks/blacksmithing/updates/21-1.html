<h1>Changes:</h1>
<ul>
 <li>Is now designed for Minecraft 1.21 and 1.21.1!</li>
 <li><b>Changed how "Too Expensive" is removed:</b></li>
 <ul>
  <li>Now you just need to <span>click on the item while in the Anvil interface</span> to remove it.</li>
  <li>This is a simpler approach, that greatly improves the project's performance. Why not?</li>
 </ul>
 <li>Anvil Recipes now supports the Crafter!</li>
 <li>After 6 years of doing this (Blacksmithing existed since 1.13), <b>we finally have icons now</b>!
 </li>
 <ul>
  <li>I'm not really good at drawing, so this is the best I've got for the project's icons.</li>
  <li>Will probably improve it later on when I'm better at doing Art stuff.</li>
 </ul>
 <li><b>Added Admin Commands!</b> To use them:</li>
 <ul>
  <li>Simply type <code>/function tdp.</code> in chat, the game should give you suggestions on what to use.</li>
  <ul>
   <li><b>Side note:</b> Any command suggestions with underscores are <b>for internal use only</b> and won't work if run on their own.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Only those with the "Allow Commands" permission can use Admin Commands.</li>
 </ul>
</ul>
<h2>Advancement Changes:</h2>
<ul>
 <li><b>Due to the massive infastructure redesign, all advancement progress have been reset.</b></li>
 <ul>
  <li>The infastructure redesign is aimed to <b>keep things consistent</b> with <a href="https://www.planetminecraft.com/collection/148146/thediamondplayables-s-datapacks/">my other releases</a>.</li>
  <li>I considered keeping the Advancement files the same specifically, which saves your progress, but it also meant I'd have to manage 2 different filesystems internally, which messes up the workflow too much for it to ever be worth it.</li>
 </ul>
 <li><b>Changed some advancement names:</b></li>
 <ul>
  <li><code>Forging a split</code> => <code>Forging Fragments</code></li>
  <li><code>Iron Forge Rebuilt</code> => <code>All Ironed Out</code></li>
 </ul>
 <li>"All Ironed Out" now also accepts Anvil repairs from Crafters.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Extra Changes:</h2>
<ul>
 <li>A lot of filenames have been changed to properly organize everything.</li>
 <ul>
  <li>IDs have been removed and is now replaced by code names.</li>
  <li>The format for commands is now <code>tdp:code_name/data</code>, to reserve the old names for Admin Commands.</li>
 </ul>
 <li>Improved the look of info text messages.</li>
 <li>Text files have been merged into one single Interactive Help File.</li>
 <ul>
  <li>I have to learn 3 new languages to get all this to work as well as it did. </li>
  <li>Not the best at it yet, but it works well enough for now.</li>
 </ul>
 <li>The master background has been updated for major releases as always.</li>
 <li>Codebase now uses Scripter 4.</li>
</ul>
<p>I spend a lot of time keeping everything up to date, making things better each update.
