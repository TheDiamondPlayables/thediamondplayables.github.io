<h1>Changes:</h1>
<ul>
 <li>Fixed a small bug causing "Forging Fragments" to not work when you recycle a full anvil.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: If the dates look off, it's because the official release went live that day without the IHF file improvements. I'm still counting it as it being released by then for simplicity sakes.</p>
