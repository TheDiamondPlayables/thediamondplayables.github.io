<p>This is a small update patching out issues found in the last update. Enjoy!</p>
<h1>Changes:</h1>
<ul>
 <li>Fixed a critical issue <b>causing items to not stack properly</b> if the new No Too Expensive is enabled.</li>
 <ul>
  <li>Sorry about that one, that was a very silly mistake on my part.</li>
  <li>Past me thought they had it all handled perfectly, and missed a pretty obvious test case as a result.</li>
  <li>Will probably not happen again, but no one is perfect.</li>
 </ul>
 <li>Fixed an issue causing Anvil Recipes' recipes to not show to players when they first joined.</li>
 <li>Reduced the filesize of the new icons used since the last update. (Less download time!)</li>
</ul>
