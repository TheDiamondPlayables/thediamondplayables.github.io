<p>Blacksmithing makes Anvils less annoying <b>by removing Too Expensive from it</b>!</p>
<p>With Blacksmithing, you can:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Put that last enchantment onto your favorite item!</li>
 <li>Use Anvils as an alternative to Mending!</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also repair your Anvils with Iron, or cut it for scraps!</p>

<blockquote>Some Anvil mechanics are just too annoying.</blockquote>
