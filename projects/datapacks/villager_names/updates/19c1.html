<p>(Also known as the A New Fresh update.)</p>
<h1>Changes:</h1>
<ul>
 <li>Is now designed for Minecraft 1.19.3 and higher.</li>
 <ul>
  <li>It's not advised to run this in older versions, I won't be able to provide much support if you do.
  <br>(Imagine having to do that for all older versions for all my datapacks, you'll see a scale issue)</li>
 </ul>
 <li>Baby Villagers now have a small chance to spawn with a different last name from it's family.</li>
 <li>Reading the names from a lot of Villagers created from a breeder isn't that interesting still,
 so I added this, which works pretty well.</li>
 <li>Name-wiped Villagers now have a new sound effect!</li>
 <li>Name wipe particle effects are now more accurate on Baby Villagers.</li>
 <li>Removed some excess tags left behind from Bloodlines' development.</li>
 <li>Zombie Villagers spawned with no names no longer spawn with the name wipe effect.</li>
 <li>Internal files have been renamed to adapt with the new dot release changes from Mojang.</li>
 <li>Updating from V19-1 to this version will cause the advancements to be reset for this to happen.</li>
</ul>
