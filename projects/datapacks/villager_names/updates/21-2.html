<h1>Changes:</h1>
<ul>
 <li>Fixed a major bug causing upgraded Villagers from pre-Scripter 4 to have a missing name unless Name Tag Commands are used.</li>
 <ul>
  <li>The component isn't used at the moment, but it would be pretty damaging to fix later when I eventually give it a gameplay use.</li>
 </ul>
</ul>
<p>Note: If the dates look off, it's because the official release went live that day without the IHF file improvements. I'm still counting it as it being released by then for simplicity sakes.</p>
