<h1>Changes:</h1>
<ul>
 <li>Is now designed for Minecraft 1.21.2 and 1.21.3!</li>
</ul>
<h2>Extra notes:</h2>
<ul>
 <li>I considered removing the whole "Villagers lose their names when Zombified" rule, now that the bug that caused Villagers to lose some data when they got Zombified got patched, but whoever patched that bug forgot to fix it the other way around (they still lose data when cured), so that's been left unchanged.</li>
 <ul>
  <li>Also because patching that bug myself would exceed the performance budget for this pack.</li>
  <li>For a datapack that adds in extra detail, I wouldn't want to use it if I know it adds a lot of lag that doesn't really need to be there. Keeping the rule is more efficient performance-wise.</li>
 </ul>
 <li>And here's a little secret: The workaround I'd designed for <code>/nameless</code> actually had a bug with it.</li>
 <ul>
  <li>You'd see a Villager death animation, if you try to clear a Villager's name while it's asleep.</li>
  <li>I considered calling another day off just to patch this, but since the workaround itself is no longer needed in 1.21.4, I decided to leave it as an easter egg for those who do read these things, which I know isn't a lot.</li>
 </ul>
</ul>
