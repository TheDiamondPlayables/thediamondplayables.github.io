<p>(Also known as the Bloodlines Mega-Update.)</p>
<h1>Changes:</h1>
<ul>
 <li>Implemented the <b>long-awaited Bloodlines feature</b>.</li>
 <ul>
  <li>When a new child is born, its last name will be the one from the parent it came from. The first name is completely randomized. It's what the child wants.</li>
  <li>This will also work if you use a Spawn Egg on a Villager to make a baby Villager.</li>
  <li>If a villager is renamed with Name Tags, it's last name is still there, but hidden.
  <br>In other words, you can't change the actual name of a Villager, at all.</li>
 </ul>
 <li>Use a Name Tag named "/realname" on any Villager to reveal it's real name.</li>
 <li>Increased the chance to see specially-named Villagers from 7.5% to 10%.</li>
 <li>Removed all names that indicated groups of people from the entire Mojang Names list.</li>
 <ul>
  <li>This took way longer than I wanted it to. Ouch.</li>
 </ul>
 <li>Added more names to the pool:</li>
 <ul>
  <li>Increased the amount of last names up to 1000 (from 100).</li>
  <li>Increased the amount of first names up to 1916 (from 200).
  <br>Also, yes, I wanted to have 2000 names, but there were 84 complete duplicates.</li>
 </ul>
 <li>Updated achievements:</li>
 <ul>
  <li>Full Name Reveal: Use a "/realname" Name Tag on a Villager to know their true identity.</li>
  <li>Long-term Investment: Trade with "Markus Persson". (Replaces "Two Billion Dollars")</li>
 </ul>
</ul>
<h1>Update Notes:</h1>
<ul>
 <li>Since the last name is effectively limited if you use a villager breeding system, I want the generator to still be able to make interesting names if you have some kind of villager breeding system going on, so I decided to amp up the pool.</li>
 <li>I'm working on a workaround to the Zombie Villager name feature.</li>
 <ul>
  <li>If I can think of a good workaround for that, I'll revert the feature without having to wait for a bugfix to do it.</li>
 </ul>
 <li>Think of Special Names generated by Villager Names to be some kind of "celebritity stage names", but for Minecraft. So their actual names are different, but they came up with a "stage name" that they mainly use in public, and the stage name is what you're seeing.</li>
 <ul>
  <li>What is known can never be unknown. You can't undo a "/realname" used on a Special Name.</li>
 </ul>
 <li>While I was going through the names I do see a lot of names that are similar-sounding.</li>
 <ul>
  <li>I might make a poll on my Discord Server on what to do with these later on in a next update.</li>
 </ul>
 <li>"Wright Brothers" is now 2 name entries: "Orville Wright" and "Wilbur Wright".</li>
 <ul>
  <li>I looked through the famous names so thoroughly ... and I missed that one. Ouch.</li>
 </ul>
</ul>
<p>Unrelated note: I have been looking up far too many baby names during the development of this pack that the ads from Google I've been getting lately gives me the feeling that Google thinks that I'm some mother about to have a baby lol. Time to clear my cookies again.</p>
