<h1>Changes:</h1>
<ul>
 <li>Is now designed for Minecraft 1.21.5!</li>
 <li>Updated advancement background to match game update's general theme.</li>
 <li>Names are now stored and loaded more efficiently using the new update's data format.</li>
 <ul>
  <li>This helps a lot if you have a lot of Villagers around.</li>
  <li>Old villagers named with this pack will be upgraded automatically.</li>
 </ul>
</ul>
<p>Note: If the dates look off, it's because the official release went live that day without the IHF file improvements. I'm still counting it as it being released by then for simplicity sakes.</p>
