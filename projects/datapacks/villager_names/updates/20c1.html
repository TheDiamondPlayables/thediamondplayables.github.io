<h1>Changes:</h1>
<ul>
 <li>Is now designed for Minecraft 1.20.3, and 1.20.4!</li>
 <li>Due to <a href="https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-267259">MC-267259</a> completely evicerating custom name removals, <code>/nameless</code> now tries its best to mask the name instead.</li>
 <li>For the same reasons, masked naming will also be applied to the Zombie Villager mechanic as well.</li>
 <ul>
  <li>This is a temporary solution while I wait for progress on <a href="https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-267259">MC-267259</a>. </li>
  <li>It's a relatively new issue, so I'll try to be a bit more hopeful on it first.</li>
 </ul>
 <li>Removed excess data from the head seen in the root advancement.</li>
