<p>Minespenser lets <b>Dispensers mine blocks</b> using tools!
<br>With a tool inside, Dispensers can be used to mine blocks!</p>
<p>Some notes with this:</p>
<ul>
 <li>This <span>supports enchanted tools</span>!</li>
 <li>Blocks only drop items <span>when the right tool is used</span>.</li>
 <li><span>Harder blocks takes more shots</span> to mine through.</li>
 <li>Mining with this is faster, though it costs a bit more durability.</li>
</ul>
