<p>BrushCover lets you <b>make your own Suspicious Blocks</b>!
<br>Simply use the Brush on Sand/Gravel with anything in your offhand to bury it in said block!</p>
<ul>
 <li>You can make some minigames with this.</li>
 <li>Or use it to bury anything you want!</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>I just like being able to cover items with the same thing used to reveal them.</blockquote>
