<h1>Changes:</h1>
<p>This small update implements the new Admin Book Updates, and improves BrushCover's mechanics.
Enjoy!</p>
<ul>
 <li>Internal book code now runs on a much better BookMaker addon.</li>
 <li>Settings are now properly saved as updates are introduced!</li>
 <li>Fixed Unbreakable tag not working on negative Unbreakable values.</li>
 <ul>
  <li>In vanilla, negative values are still unbreakable, so yeah.</li>
 </ul>
 <li>Improved execution on <a href="https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-260225">MC-260225</a> patch.</li>
 <ul>
  <li><b>Please vote for the issue</b> to get it patched soon!</li>
 </ul>
 <li><span>Cover Limits</span> is now off by default.</li>
 <ul>
  <li>This won't change the value if you have a previous version BrushCover activated though.</li>
 </ul>
 <li>Edit Buttons now refresh the book to update modified values as the button is used.</li>
 <li><span>Last Modified</span> is now <span>Last Refresh</span> as that's more accurate.</li>
 <li>Added a gap between the edit command's command and the command response to put those 2 apart.</li>
</ul>
