<p>Fishing Extended adds <b>a lot of new items to fish</b>!
<br>The new items are designed to make fishing more exciting while also keeping the fish count for those fishing for it.</p>
<p>A rough list of what you can expect:</p>
<ul>
 <li>A new "<b>Ocean Items</b>" category, with things you could see being in the ocean at that area.</li>
 <li>Chance to <b>catch entire schools of fish</b>!</li>
 <li><b>Fishing Crates</b>, filled with all sorts of stuff!</li>
 <li>More <span tabindex=0 class=tooltip><span class=tooltipText>Each treasure item has its own pros and cons to keep them balanced.</span>treasures</span> and junk to catch!</li>
 <li>And <span>so much more</span>!</li>
</ul>
