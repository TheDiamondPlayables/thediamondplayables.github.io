<h1>Important changes:</h1>
<ul>
 <li>Is now designed for Minecraft 1.19.4.</li>
 <ul>
  <li>It's not advised to run this in older versions, I won't be able to provide much support if you do.
  <br>(Imagine having to do that for all older versions for all my datapacks, you'll see a scale issue)</li>
 </ul>
</ul>
<h1><span tabindex=0 class=tooltip><span class=tooltipText>Just me polishing some stuff in the background.</span>Non-gameplay changes:</span></h1>
<ul>
 <li>Codebase now runs on Scripter 3.1.</li>
 <li><span>TheDiamondPlayables</span> is now colored in <span style="color: #00BBBB">dark aqua</span> by design. (grey-ish aqua?)</li>
 <ul>
  <li>The old design feels more vanilla, but it doesn't sit right with me.
  <br>Seeing a gray TheDiamondPlayables just feel ... off.</li>
 </ul>
