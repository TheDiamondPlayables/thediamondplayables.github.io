<h1>Important Note:</h1>
<ul>
 <li>SpawnerCarts made before this patch can no longer be dropped off due to the new changes.</li>
 <ul>
  <li>To prevent this, please make sure all SpawnerCarts have been dropped off before updating.</li>
  <li>Sorry for any inconvenience this might cause you, this won't happen again.</li>
 </ul>
</ul>
<h1>Additions:</h1>
<ul>
 <li>SpawnerCarts are now properly labeled to avoid clashing with other projects.</li>
 <ul>
  <li>As a side-effect though, unlabeled SpawnerCarts can't be interacted with anymore.</li>
 </ul>
 <li>Spawners now pop out if the SpawnerCart is destroyed by any means.</li>
 <ul>
  <li>This was changed to be consistent with how other entities are popped out of their vehicles in vanilla.</li>
 </ul>
</ul>
<h1>Changes:</h1>
<ul>
 <li>Cagey Dropoff now gives you more Experience upon completion.</li>
 <ul>
  <li>You're more likely to miss this one now that the new mechanic exists.</li>
  <li>So I figured I'd add a bit more experience for those who did notice it.</li>
  <li>Also, I've reset this achievement's progression.</li>
 </ul>
 <li>Updated SpawnerCart's particle effects upon caught/dropoff.</li>
 <li>Optimized some places throughout SpawnerCart's code.</li>
 <li>SpawnerCarts now only drops the Minecart if <code>doEntityDrops</code> gamerule is activated.</li>
</ul>
