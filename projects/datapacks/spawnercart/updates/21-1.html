<h1>Changes:</h1>
<ul>
 <li>Is now designed for Minecraft 1.21 and 1.21.1!</li>
 <li>Activator Rails <b>now tries to place the Spawner in places that doesn't block the railway</b> if it can.</li>
 <ul>
  <li>Now you can drop Spawners off without cutting your own tracks, letting you drop off multiple Spawners remotely before having to go back to check on them.</li>
  <li>This is a thing unique to Activator Rails, mainly because placing Spawners where you broke the Cart in is more predictable, and it also adds value to this often forgotten block.</li>
 </ul>
 <li><b>Added 3 in-game Settings</b> to SpawnerCart:</li>
 <ul>
  <li><span>Dimensional Carts</span>: If Spawner Minecarts can cross Nether/End Portals. This has gameplay-altering applications and is off by default.</li>
  <li><span>Drop on Break</span>: If Spawners drop itself when the Cart is broken. On by default.</li>
  <li><span>Mobile Spawners</span>: If Spawner Minecarts spawns entities while moving. On by default.</li>
 </ul>
 <li>Improved how the pack works with the new features added by the game.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Extras:</h1>
<ul>
 <li>Added Admin Commands! To use these commands:</li>
 <ul>
  <li>Simply type <code>/function tdp.</code>, and the game should give you suggestions on what to use.
  <br><b>Side note:</b> Any suggestions <b>with underscores followed by numbers</b> are <b>for internal use only</b> and won't work if run on their own.</li>
  <li>Only those with the "Allow Commands" permission can use Admin Commands.</li>
 </ul>
 <li>A lot of filenames have been changed to properly organize everything.</li>
 <ul>
  <li>IDs have been removed and is now replaced by code names.</li>
  <li>The format is now tdp:code_name/data, to reserve the old names for Admin Commands.</li>
 </ul>
 <li>After 6 years of making datapacks, <span>we finally have icons now!</span></li>
 <li>Improved the look of info text messages.</li>
 <li>Text files have been merged into one single Interactive Help File.</li>
 <ul>
  <li>I have to learn 3 new languages to get all this to work as well as it did. </li>
  <li>Not the best at it yet, but it works well enough for now.</li>
 </ul>
 <li>The master background has been updated for major releases as always.</li>
 <li>Codebase now uses Scripter 4.</li>
</ul>
