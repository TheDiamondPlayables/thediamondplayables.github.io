<p>After going through the update in detail, I figured out that there's not a lot of reasonable changes that needs to be made, so don't expect much for this update. Enjoy!</p>
<h1>Changes:</h1>
<ul>
 <li>Is now designed for Minecraft 1.21.6 and <span class=tooltip><span class=tooltipText>This is a hotfix so it'll be working fine on this release.</span>1.21.7</span>!</li>
 <li>Updated advancement background to match game update's theme.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Development notes:</h2>
<p>In 1.21.6, Mojang made a sweeping change which makes clickable texts significantly more annoying by <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-java-edition-1-21-6#:~:text=Users%20will%20now%20be%20prompted%20for%20confirmation%20before%20executing%20a%20command%20from%20the%20run_command%20click%20action%20in%20books%20and%20chat%20if%20the%20command%20can%27t%20be%20parsed%20or%20requires%20elevated%20permissions">adding a forced confirmation screen</a> behind each and every one of them. <span class=tooltip><span class=tooltipText>Best I can think of is that it at least makes it harder for server owners to harm their servers by interacting with arbitrary click actions.</span>There's a good reason as to why they've done this</span>, but the side effect of that change will affect your experience with Admin Books moving forward.
<br>I'll be dropping another patch in the future to work around this issue, though that'll most likely come sometime after the Update Series is finished. For now though, have fun with SpawnerCart!</p>
