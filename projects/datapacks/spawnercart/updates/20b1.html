<h1>Changes:</h1>
<ul>
 <li>Is now designed for Minecraft 1.20.2!</li>
 <li>SpawnerCarts are now tagged with <code>tdp.datapacks</code>.</li>
 <ul>
  <li>Pack makers could use this to exclude tagged entities I'd made to avoid combo issues, if there's any.</li>
  <li>This only affects SpawnerCarts made after this update though.</li>
 </ul>
</ul>
