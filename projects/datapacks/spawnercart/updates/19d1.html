<h1>Important changes:</h1>
<ul>
 <li>Is now designed for Minecraft 1.19.4!</li>
 <ul>
  <li>It's not advised to run this in older versions, I won't be able to provide much support if you do.
  <br>(Imagine having to do that for all older versions for all my datapacks, you'll see a scale issue)</li>
 </ul>
 <li>"Up Goes The Rail" now rewards an extra 10 EXP points upon completion.</li>
 <ul>
  <li>Appearantly I forgot to add a small EXP reward for this when I first designed it. Whoopsies!</li>
 </ul>
</ul>
<h1><span tabindex=0 class=tooltip><span class=tooltipText>Just me polishing some stuff in the background.</span>Non-gameplay changes:</span></h1>
<ul>
 <li>Codebase now runs on Scripter 3.1.</li>
 <li>SpawnerCart's now using the new stuff from 1.19.4 to improve its performance.</li>
 <ul>
  <li>SpawnerCart should run a bit more efficiently than its previous version.</li>
 </ul>
 <li>Reworked SpawnerCart's advancement names:</li>
 <ul>
  <li>"Spawner on Wheels" and "Cagey Dropoff" now replaces the old advancement names.
  <br>(previously "A Cage on Wheels" and "Drop it off!" respectively)</li>
  <li>I couldn't really come up with a decent name back then, so I had to leave them as they are for the release - that or a lot of time would be spent into better names for a set of tutorial advancements.</li>
  <li>I'm quite happy with these names though, so these are now shipped instead.</li>
 </ul>
 <li><span>TheDiamondPlayables</span> is now colored in <span style="color: #00BBBB">dark aqua</span> by design. (grey-ish aqua?)</li>
 <ul>
  <li>The old design feels more vanilla, but it doesn't sit right with me.
  <br>Seeing a gray TheDiamondPlayables just feel ... off.</li>
 </ul>
</ul>
