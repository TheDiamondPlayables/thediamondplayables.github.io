<p>Merchant is an <b>improved Wandering Trader</b> that offers fairer trades!
<br>The Merchant also spawn in all 3 dimensions, offering dimension-specific trades from all over the world!</p>
<ul>
 <li>Merchant's offers <span>reflect the items' rarity</span> in the world.</li>
 <li>This makes non-renewables <span>renewable at a reasonable cost</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Merchant does not affect vanilla Wandering Traders' mechanics.
<br>Just so you can compare between the two.</p>

<blockquote>Honestly though, the Wandering Trader's deals are just bad.</blockquote>
