<h1>Changes:</h1>
<ul>
 <li><span>Is now designed for 1.21 and 1.21.1!</span></li>
 <li><b>Added the Rocket Ladder</b> that lets you drop Ladders upwards!</li>
 <ul>
  <li>To craft Rocket Ladders, surround Ladders with a piece of Firework Rocket to make 8 of them!</li>
  <li>Throwing Rocket Ladders at a Ladder sends it up, placing Ladders as it goes!</li>
  <li>All Firework Rockets produce the same Rocket Ladder currently, so use the cheapest one you got.</li>
 </ul>
 <li>Admins can also give themselves custom items added by my projects with <span>the new give Command</span>!</li>
 <ul>
  <li>Syntax: <code>/function tdp.give:dropladder/&ltitem&gt {count:&lt1-6400&gt}</code></li>
 </ul>
 <li><span>Added custom stacksizes support</span> for Ladders and Rocket Ladders!</li>
 <li>New Achievements:</li>
 <ul>
  <li><span>Discount Rocket Science</span>: Craft some Rocket Ladders with the cheapest Rockets you can find!</li>
  <li><span>To Infinity ... And Beyond!</span>: Send Rocket Ladders flying by throwing them onto a Ladder!</li>
 </ul>
 <li>Tweaked description for "Let Down Your Ladder" to increase clarity in the wording.</li>
 <li>Massively improved Chainbreaking performance, especially at scale!</li>
 <ul>
  <li>The pack takes a while longer than my others to be installed in some cases, but it's well worth it afterwards.</li>
 </ul>
 <li><span>Chainbreaking now seamlessly works with other custom made blocks added via mods.</span></li>
 <ul>
  <li>In theory: If the mod respects vanilla Ladder mechanics, Chainbreaking should have no problems with it.</li>
  <li><b>Note: This is nothing more than just a side-effect of the performance improvement change.</b></li>
 </ul>
 <li>Fixed bugs:</li>
 <ul>
  <li>Fixed an issue that could cause Chainbreaking to randomly fail if the Ladder is too long.</li>
  <li>Fixed some edge cases that caused Chainbreaking to trigger where it's not supposed to.</li>
 </ul>
</ul>
<h1>Extras:</h1>
<ul>
 <li>Added Admin Commands! To use these commands:</li>
 <ul>
  <li>Simply type <code>/function tdp.</code>, and the game should give you suggestions on what to use.
  <br><b>Side note:</b> Any suggestions <b>with underscores followed by numbers</b> are <b>for internal use only</b> and won't work if run on their own.</li>
  <li>Only those with the "Allow Commands" permission can use Admin Commands.</li>
 </ul>
 <li>A lot of filenames have been changed to properly organize everything.</li>
 <ul>
  <li>IDs have been removed and is now replaced by code names.</li>
  <li>The format is now tdp:code_name/data, to reserve the old names for Admin Commands.</li>
 </ul>
 <li>After 6 years of making datapacks, <span>we finally have icons now!</span></li>
 <li>Improved the look of info text messages.</li>
 <li>Text files have been merged into one single Interactive Help File.</li>
 <ul>
  <li>I have to learn 3 new languages to get all this to work as well as it did. </li>
  <li>Not the best at it yet, but it works well enough for now.</li>
 </ul>
 <li>The master background has been updated for major releases as always.</li>
 <li>Codebase now uses Scripter 4.</li>
</ul>
