<h1>Changes:</h1>
<ul>
 <li>Chainbreaking improvements:</li>
 <ul>
  <li>Removed blocks that can't actually support Ladders, and added more blocks that can.
  <br>(I actually missed quite a few blocks that should've been in the list, but aren't)</li>
  <li>Further improved Chainbreaking's performance.</li>
 </ul>
 <li>Updated the Advancement Tab's background.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Notes for Modders:</h2>
<ul>
 <li>I've improved the code with 1.20 stuff, so function files have been changed, a lot.</li>
 <li>Updated all block tag definitions for 1.20.</li>
 <li>All ladder support cases for Chainbreaking have been merged to predicates wherever possible.</li>
 <ul> 
  <li>Check those out if you need to add in your own blocks to work with DropLadder!</li>
 </ul>
</ul>
