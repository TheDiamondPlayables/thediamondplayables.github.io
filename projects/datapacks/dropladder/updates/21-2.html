<p>My packs are designed for Vanilla, and works really well with my other packs.
<br>But I try to make it so it'll also work with others' stuff as best I can. Mainly because I know that most of you would use my stuff with others' things, and having them just work together well would make things more fun for ya - even though I know close to nothing about others' things, or which ones you're using. This is one of those times.</p>
