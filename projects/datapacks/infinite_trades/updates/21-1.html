<h1>Changes:</h1>
<ul>
 <li>Is now designed for Minecraft 1.21 and 1.21.1!</li>
 <li><span>"Hefty Business"</span> is now <span>"Millions In The Market"</span>, and the resulting item is now also fireproof.</li>
 <li>The tag used to remove the Infinite Trades effect on custom entities <b>has now been changed</b>, from <code>tdp.504.skip</code> to <code>tdp.infinite_trades.skip</code>, due to the changes to internal ID systems used in the pack.</li>
 <ul>
  <li>The old tag will be kept around for a few versions, but if you're using this tag in your creations, I'd recommend upgrading to the new one as soon as possible!</li>
 </ul>
</ul>

<ul>
 <li>Added Admin Commands! To use these commands:</li>
 <ul>
