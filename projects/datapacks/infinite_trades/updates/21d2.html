<h1>Changes:</h1>
<ul>
 <li>Further improves pack performance when a trade is performed.</li>
 <ul>
  <li>This should help out greatly if the world has a lot of Villagers loaded at once.</li>
 </ul>
 <li>For pack devs:</li>
 <ul>
  <li>Removed support for old bypass tag <code>tdp.504.skip</code>. Use the new <code>tdp.infinite_trades.skip</code> instead!</li>
 </ul>
 <li>Updated advancement background to match game update's theme.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: If the dates look off, it's because the official release went live that day without the IHF file improvements. I'm still counting it as it being released by then for simplicity sakes.</p>
