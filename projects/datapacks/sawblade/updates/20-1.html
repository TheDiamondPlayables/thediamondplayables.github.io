 <li>Optimized the Damage algorithm with 1.20 stuff!</li>
 <li>Fixed a bug that stops Damage from dealing damage to entities in a team without friendly fire.</li>
</ul>
<h2>New Recipes Recap:</h2>
<ul>
 <li>Hanging Signs can be cut into either Stripped Logs or Iron Nuggets.</li>
 <li>Cherry Wood and Bamboo Blocks acts the same as every other wood.</li>
 <li>Special cases for Bamboo Blocks though:</li>
 <ul>
  <li>Bamboo Block = 2 Planks instead of 4.</li>
  <li>Bamboo Mosaic can be swapped with their non-Mosaic variant in the Stonecutter.</li>
  <li>Bamboo Blocks can't be cut into Bamboo Fence Gate.</li>
  <li>Bamboo Blocks can be cut back into Bamboo, but not Stripped Bamboo Blocks.</li>
 </ul>
 <li>Chiseled Bookshelves can now be cut into Sticks.</li>
 <li>Calibrated Sculk Sensor can either be cut into 3 Amethyst Shards or the Sculk Sensor.</li>
 <li>Mangrove Roots can now be cut into a stick.</li>
 <ul>
  <li>Mojang classified this as being wood, but it's not planks worthy, so 1 stick.</li>
 </ul>
</ul>
<p>Because of the chain rule, these rules expanded into 62 new recipes.
<br>PS: I know <a href="https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-143214">MC-143214</a> exists now. Cool.</p>
