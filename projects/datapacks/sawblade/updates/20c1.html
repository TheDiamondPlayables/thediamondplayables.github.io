<h1>Changes:</h1>
<ul>
 <li>Is now designed for Minecraft 1.20.3, and 1.20.4!</li>
 <li>Added new recipes that previously didn't work due to Relationship Manager's stack size limitations.</li>
 <ul>
  <li>I actually don't have all of them documented, so I'll slowly add them as time goes on.</li>
 </ul>
 <li>Removed excess data from the head seen in the root advancement.</li>
 <li>The game should now read texts better, leveraging the new text improvements.</li>
</ul>
<h2>New Recipes:</h2>
<ul>
 <li>Snow Layers can now be cut into Snowballs.</li>
 <li>Snow Blocks can now be cut into 4 Snow Layers.</li>
 <ul>
  <li>Any number bigger than 4 leads to snow duplication, despite it's visual inconsistency.</li>
  <li>This is better than the Crafting Table's 1:2 ratio though, so you can see why I wanted this.</li>
 </ul>
 <li>Packed Ice can finally be cut into 9 Ice.</li>
 <li>Blue Ice can finally be cut into 9 Packed Ice.</li>
 <li>Due to Relationship Manager shenanigans, 7 new recipes have been added to the pack!</li>
</ul>
