<h1>Changes</h1>
<ul>
 <li>Is now designed for Minecraft 1.21.5!</li>
 <li>Updated advancement background to match game update's general theme.</li>
 <li>Added new Partial Cutback recipe for Lodestone.</li>
 <li>Stonecutters no longer detach attached blocks when it deals damage.</li>
 <ul>
  <li>You'd expect this to be obvious behavior, but it can't be realistically done before 1.21.5.</li>
  <li>Also, I did leave it so that Stonecutters would still cause block updates as it does damage as that can be used for some fun shenanigans, so do enjoy that.</li>
 </ul>
</ul>
<p>Note: If the dates look off, it's because the official release went live that day without the IHF file improvements. I'm still counting it as it being released by then for simplicity sakes.</p>
