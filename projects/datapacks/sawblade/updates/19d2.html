<h1>Changes:</h1>
<ul>
 <li>Fixed a minor installation bug that caused showDeathMessages gamerule to be <span>permanently set to False</span> when Sawblade Damage is installed for the first time.</li>
 <ul>
  <li>If you're affected by this, simply set <code>showDeathMessages</code> gamerule again.</li>
 </ul>
