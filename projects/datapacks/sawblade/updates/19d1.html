<h1>Important changes:</h1>
<ul>
 <li>Is now designed for Minecraft 1.19.4 and higher.</li>
 <ul>
  <li>It's not advised to run this in older versions, I won't be able to provide much support if you do.
  <br>(Imagine having to do that for all older versions for all my datapacks, you'll see a scale issue)</li>
 </ul>
 <li>Fixed a bug that caused player owned pets (parrots,cats,wolves) to not show their Death Message to their owners properly if killed by a Stonecutter.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Gameplay changes:</h1>
<ul>
 <li>Damage dealt by the Stonecutter to players now <b>always scales with difficulty</b>.</li>
 <li>Driving a Minecart with TNT into a Sawblade <b>now triggers an explosion</b> when the Minecart is destroyed.</li>
 <li>Minecart with Furnace is no longer immune to Sawblade Damage.</li>
 <li>Sandcrusher now accepts Red Sand related crafts.</li>
 <li>Mud Bricks can now make Packed Mud.</li>
 <li>Villagers now take reduced damage from Stonecutters.</li>
 <ul>
  <li>Rules need to be consistent for all living entities, but Villagers have been working with an open sawblade for ages. Sometimes accidents happen.</li>
 </ul>
 <li>Villagers now try to hop out of the way if they are damaged by a Sawblade.</li>
 <ul>
  <li>This should result in some pretty funny interactions whenever you're looking around the world.</li>
  <li>Shoutout to <a href="https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/450-new-recipes-stonecutter-damage-sawblade-1-18x/comment/9974194/#reply_9974194">Kiroto50 on PMC for calling out</a> what I called the Mason Stonecutter issue.
  <br>Completely skipped past this problem when I first developed it. Whoops!
  <br>(I didn't use their suggestion though, which was simpler, but wouldn't be as fun)</li>
 </ul>
</ul>
<h1><span class="tooltip"><span class="tooltipText">Just me polishing some stuff in the background.</span>Non-gameplay changes:</span></h1>
<ul>
 <li>Codebase now runs on Scripter 3.1.</li>
 <li>Changed the highlight color to be more consistent with advancements from my other packs.</li>
 <li>Tweaked the particle effects to be a bit more visible.</li>
 <li>Optimized the Sawblade Damage system with the techniques introduced in 1.19.4.</li>
 <ul>
  <li>This also removed the super secret easter egg that existed in all my previous versions, but who's hunting for them anyway, right?</li>
 </ul>
 <li><span>TheDiamondPlayables</span> is now colored in <span style="color: #00BBBB">dark aqua</span> by design. (grey-ish aqua?)</li>
 <ul>
  <li>The old design feels more vanilla, but it doesn't sit right with me.
  <br>Seeing a gray TheDiamondPlayables just feel ... off.</li>
 </ul>
</ul>
