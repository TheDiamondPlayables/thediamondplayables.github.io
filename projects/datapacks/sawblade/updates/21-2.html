<p>I try to take care of all edge-cases in vanilla so you can have all the fun, even if you're in some wacky world with a wacky setting, and I actually missed a new one 1.21 (1.20.5 actually, but still). There are so much more of these since 1.20.5 - this is bound to happen at some point.</p>
<h1>Changes:</h1>
<ul>
 <li>Fixed a critical bug causing <span>Sawblade Damage to not run properly if spawnChunkRadius is off</span>. To fix this:</li>
 <ol>
  <li>Run: <code>/gamerule spawnChunkRadius 1</code> for a second</li>
  <li>Then, run: <code>/gamerule spawnChunkRadius 0</code> to turn it off again.</li>
  <li>That should fix everything.</li>
 </ol>
</ul>
