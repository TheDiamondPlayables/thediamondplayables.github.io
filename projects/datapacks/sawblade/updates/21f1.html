<h2>Development notes:</h2>
<p><b>Dried Ghasts can't be cut back</b> to prevent it from becoming an alternate source to Ghast Tears.
<br>This is similar to why Quartz Blocks can't be cut back into Nether Quartz - you can also get Quartz Blocks in the Overworld via Trading.</p>
<p>In 1.21.6, Mojang made a sweeping change which makes clickable texts significantly more annoying by <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-java-edition-1-21-6#:~:text=Users%20will%20now%20be%20prompted%20for%20confirmation%20before%20executing%20a%20command%20from%20the%20run_command%20click%20action%20in%20books%20and%20chat%20if%20the%20command%20can%27t%20be%20parsed%20or%20requires%20elevated%20permissions">adding a forced confirmation screen</a> behind each and every one of them. <span class=tooltip><span class=tooltipText>Best I can think of is that it at least makes it harder for server owners to harm their servers by interacting with arbitrary click actions.</span>There's a good reason as to why they've done this</span>, but the side effect of that change will affect your experience with Admin Books moving forward.
<br>I'll be dropping another patch in the future to work around this issue, though that'll most likely come sometime after the Update Series is finished. For now though, have fun with Sawblade!</p>
