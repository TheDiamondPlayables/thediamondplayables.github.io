<p>(Also known as the Cutting Edge update)</p>
<h1>Changes:</h1>
<ul>
 <li>Is now designed for Minecraft 1.19.3!</li>
 <li>Sawblade Damage's algorithm have been reworked to be more efficient!</li>
 <li>Stonecutter now causes a block update whenever it deals damage!</li>
 <ul> 
  <li>Could be useful if used properly, I guess. </li>
  <li>Up to the redstone experts for this one.</li>
 </ul>
 <li>Extra detail changes: </li>
 <ul>
  <li>Damage particles have been updated to better reflect the Sharpness nature of its blades.</li>
  <li>Arrows and Spectral Arrows are now immediately cut off if landed on a Stonecutter.</li>
 </ul>
 <li>All Sawblade have been thoroughly looked at and reworked completely.</li>
 <ul>
  <li>The rework aims to improve the Stonecutter while not replacing the use of the Crafting Table.</li>
  <li>The rework also aims to not change the purpose of the game's items in any major way.
   <br>Minor changes are fine though, like cutting moss away from cobblestone, or unpolishing blocks.</li>
  <li>As a result though, recipes that didn't follow the design goals have been removed.
   <br>RIP quartz from blocks. You still have to go to the Nether for them now.</li>
 </ul>
 <li>Sawblade Recipes are now generated by a Relationship Manager.</li>
 <ul>
  <li>The Relationship Manager takes existing item relationships, and automatically forges new ones that make sense based on that.</li>
  <li>So for example: 1 Log can make 4 planks. And 2 planks can make 4 sticks. Relationship Manager sees that, and adds a recipe where 1 log can make 8 sticks.</li>
  <li>With this tool I only need to add a very small collection of basic relationships, and the Manager will do all the logical thinking for me.</li>
 </ul>
 <li>The general rules for the Relationship Manager goes as follows:</li>
 <ul>
  <li><span>Bridge the gap</span>: If A can make B, and B can make C, then A can make C with adjusted item counts.
  <br>Resulting item counts are adjusted as if you were doing those 2 steps in order.</li>
  <li><span>More is good</span>: If both A and B can make C, choose the recipe that gives you more of C.
  <br>That's what you'd be doing anyway if you're doing 2 steps in order.</li>
  <li>There are more rules I have to keep track of, but I'll skip those as they're not as important.</li>
 </ul>
 <li>New Advancements:</li>
 <ul>
  <li>It hurts now?: It hurts now. (literally all the introduction you'll ever need to Sawblade Damage)</li>
  <li>There and Back Again: Powderize Concrete with the Stonecutter!</li>
  <li>Stainless Glass?: De-stain Glass with the Stonecutter.</li>
  <li>I saw some wood: Cut for Planks with the Stonecutter.</li>
  <li>Splitting Fiber: Split for Wool with the big blade.</li>
  <li>Thin Slices: Cut for String with the Stonecutter.</li>
  <li>Waxed Age Scraper: Scrape for Waxed Copper Blocks with the Stonecutter!</li>
  <li>Nether Salvage: Cut for Nether Brick with the Stonecutter!</li>
  <li>Sandcrusher: Crush for Sand with the Stonecutter!</li>
  <li>Mossy Business: Cut for Mossy Cobblestone with the Stonecutter.</li>
  <li>Finely Crushed: Make Gravel with the Stonecutter!</li>
 </ul>
 <li>Recipe Fixes:</li>
 <ul>
  <li>Fixed the inconsistency between Purpur Blocks and Popped Chorus Fruit ratios, leading to Purpur duplication. </li>
  <li>Yeah for some reason I thought it was a 1-4 ratio when it was a 1-1.</li>
 </ul>
</ul>
