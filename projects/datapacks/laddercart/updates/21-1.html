<p>I originally moved LadderCart back because I figured I could add a lot more to the pack now that Mojang's also implementing Minecart updates. Then I realized that implementing those new things come with a risk that has a chance to permanently break your worlds, and I don't want to do that, so that plan is off. So uh, sorry for the long wait that ultimately didn't work out that well. At least this long delay is a one-off, and that's finally over.</p>
