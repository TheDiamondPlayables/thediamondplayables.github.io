<p>RepliSherd lets you <b>easily replicate pottery sherds</b>!
<br>This saves you time that would otherwise be spent on going to the same structure just to get the chance of getting the same sherd again.</p>
<p>This also lets you have tons of Sherds for builds or minigames!
<br>In order to replicate it though, you still need to get the Sherd you want for the first time.</p>

<blockquote>I just don't want to revisit the same areas just to get more of the same sherd.</blockquote>
