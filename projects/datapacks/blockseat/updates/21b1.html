<h1>Changes:</h1>
<ul>
 <li>Is now designed for Minecraft 1.21.2-1.21.3!</li>
 <li>Changed BlockSeat's internal execution due to secret entity processing changes found in this version.</li>
 <ul>
  <li>As a result, you'll have limited access if you're trying to interact directly downwards while sitting.</li>
  <li>I'll work around that little problem completely if I got a better plan for this in future patches.</li>
 </ul>
</ul>
