<p>Note for those updating from V18x:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Due to V19x being made completely from scratch without looking at previous versions,
 <br>(data loss, more details on Discord) some details from V18x may not be available yet.</li>
 <li>For best experience, be sure to uninstall the previous version before installing this one.</li>
 <li>Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause you, it won't happen again in future updates.</li>
 <ul>
  <li>I have improved systems and extra measures put in place to make sure this is the case.</li>
 </ul>
</ul>
