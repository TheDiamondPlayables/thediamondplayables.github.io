<p>(Also known as "A New Seat" update)</p>

<p>Note: Starting a small experiment to try and categorize the new stuff in each update log.</p>

<p><b>Note if you're updating from an older version:</b></p>
<ul>
 <li>Be sure to uninstall the previous version before moving up to v19d1.</li>
 <li>The code has been reworked to include all the new stuff from 1.19.4, and has also been optimized to run even better, too!</li>
 <ul>
  <li>That also means that old stuff from previous versions won't run in v19d1, so if you want to keep things clean, uninstall v19c1 before updating!</li>
 </ul>
</ul>

<h1>Important Changes:</h1>
<ul>
 <li>Is now designed for Minecraft 1.19.4 and higher.</li>
 <ul>
  <li>It's not advised to run this in older versions, I won't be able to provide much support if you do.
  <br>(Imagine having to do that for all older versions for all my datapacks, you'll see a scale issue)</li>
 </ul>
 <li>You can now sit underwater!</li>
 <li>You can now sit on Fences, Walls and Fence Gates!</li>
 <ul>
  <li>You must be able to stand on top of the Fence in order to sit on it.</li>
  <li>Fence Gates must be closed in order to be sat on.
  <br>(which is kinda obvious, but still mentioning it just in case!)</li>
 </ul>
 <li>For lower stair blocks: The sitting position is now always on the lower half of the block.</li>
 <li>Sitting on top of Chests now locks it up while you're sitting on it.</li>
 <li>The codebase was also redesigned for 1.19.4 to include some new features as well as making them run better overall.</li>
 <ul>
  <li>The new approach came at a cost though: The cushion's been removed.
  <br>I'll find a way to bring it back in the future, but for now it is what it is.</li>
 </ul>
 <li>Fixed a case where you'd get <span class=tooltip><span class=tooltipText>previously "Time to Rest!"</span>"Time to Sit Down!" advancement</span> without having to sit in a seat.</li>
 <ul>
  <li>Because of this, "Time to Sit Down!" completion has been reset for everyone.</li>
  <li>The advancement's EXP reward was also shifted to 15, from 10.</li>
 </ul>
 <li>Removed more items from the valid items to sit in list.</li>
 <ul>
  <li>Some items removed: Boats, Minecarts, End Crystal, Cocoa Beans, Sweet/Glow Berries, ...</li>
  <li>These items are selected because you might sit down when you don't want to, but did because you absentmindedly crouched at the time.</li>
  <li>Another note: You can still use everything when you've sat down.</li>
 </ul>
</ul>

<h1><span tabindex=0 class=tooltip><span class=tooltipText>Just me polishing some stuff in the background.</span>Non-gameplay changes:</span></h1>
<ul>
 <li>Codebase now runs on Scripter 3.1.</li>
 <ul>
  <li>Actually the entire code was reworked from scratch to apply all the new stuff 1.19.4 has to offer.</li>
  <li>BlockSeat should perform a lot better because of this.</li>
 </ul>
 <li>Yes, "Time to Sit Down!" used to be "Time to Rest!".</li>
 <ul>
  <li>Might change it again later if I got a better name for it.</li>
 </ul>
 <li><span>TheDiamondPlayables</span> is now colored in <span style="color: #00BBBB">dark aqua</span> by design. (grey-ish aqua?)</li>
 <ul>
  <li>The old design feels more vanilla, but it doesn't sit right with me.
  <br>Seeing a gray TheDiamondPlayables just feel ... off.</li>
 </ul>
</ul>
