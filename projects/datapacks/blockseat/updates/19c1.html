<p>Version 19-2 for Minecraft 1.19.3 is here, alongside a major description overhaul as well! Hope you all enjoy!</p>

<h1>Changes:</h1>
<ul>
 <li>Is now designed for Minecraft 1.19.3 and higher.</li>
 <ul>
  <li>It's not advised to run this in older versions, I won't be able to provide much support if you do.
  <br>(Imagine having to do that for all older versions for all my datapacks, you'll see a scale issue)</li>
 </ul>
 <li>Chairs will no longer spawn if you're underwater.</li>
 <ul>
  <li>You can't really sit still underwater anyways.</li>
 </ul>
 <li>Fixed a rare visual glitch where chairs would flash above the player's position when it spawns.</li>
 <li>Internal files have been renamed to adapt with the new dot release changes from Mojang.</li>
 <ul>
  <li>Updating from V19-1 to this version will cause the advancements to be reset for this to happen.</li>
 </ul>
</ul>
