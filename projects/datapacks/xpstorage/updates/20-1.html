<p>This update officially brings XPStorage to Minecraft 1.20!
<br>Got some small detail changes for this one, plus some performance improvements, so have fun!</p>
<h1>Changes:</h1>
<ul>
 <li>Drinking an EXP Jar now has extra effects on the drinker.</li>
 <ul>
  <li>Just some extra details for this so it doesn't feel like drinking a regular Potion.</li>
 </ul>
 <li>Fixed a bug where XPStorage would repeat past choices before actually reverting settings to default.</li>
 <ul>
  <li>It should tell you the default settings information instead, since that's now relevant.</li>
 </ul>
 <li>Fixed a bug that caused the EXP Jar to overlap if an EXP Jar is used to make another EXP Jar.</li>
 <ul>
  <li>Found it while I was going through the code for the 1.20 update, so I fixed it.</li>
  <li>It was an embarrasing typo to be honest. I was so confident with that too, I didn't even test it.</li>
 </ul>
 <li>Improved XPStorage' code with 1.20 stuff.</li>
 <li>Updated Advancement Background to match 1.20.</li>
</ul>
