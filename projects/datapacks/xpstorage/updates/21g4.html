<p>I needed to fix a critical bug with Admin Settings, but I don't want to leave you with just that, so I'm porting some changes made in <span class=tooltip><span class=tooltipText>Originally meant for Minecraft 1.21.11</span>the 21k branch</span> that I think would work well down here as well. Have fun!</p>

<h1>Changes:</h1>
<ul>
 <li>New built-in Preset: <span class=tooltip><span class=tooltipText>Higher stack sizes, but less Experience per jar.</span>Bulky Edition</span></li>
 <li>Built-in preset "<span>Hardened</span>" has been renamed to "<span>Master Mode</span>".</li>
 <ul>
  <li>The original name doesn't really show the vision behind it as well.</li>
 </ul>
 <li>Fixed a bug causing the Load Preset command to not load the saved max stack value for all EXP Jars.</li>
</ul>
