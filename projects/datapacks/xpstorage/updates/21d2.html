<h1>Changes:</h1>
<ul>
 <li>Fixed a grammatical error found in "The Dragon's Load" challenge description.</li>
 <ul>
  <li>It was a remnant of a previous version of the challenge that was left in the main release.</li>
  <li>The original description for it was "Drink an Ender EXP Jar at it's maximum capacity!"</li>
 </ul>
 <li>Improved pack performance by cutting down on excess function calls and simplifying pack logic.</li>
 <li>Updated advancement background to match game update's theme.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: If the dates look off, it's because the official release went live that day without the IHF file improvements. I'm still counting it as it being released by then for simplicity sakes.</p>
