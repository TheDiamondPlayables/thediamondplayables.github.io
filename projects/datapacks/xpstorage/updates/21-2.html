<h1>Changes:</h1>
<ul>
 <li>Improved pack performance by cutting down on excess function calls and simplifying pack logic.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: If the dates look off, it's because the official release went live that day without the IHF file improvements. I'm still counting it as it being released by then for simplicity sakes.</p>
