<h1>Changes:</h1>
<ul>
 <li>The installation file was mistakenly referencing Decapitation's settings instead. Sorry about that!</li>
 <ul>
  <li>I sometimes mess up IDs when I'm writing these documentations. </li>
  <li>Most of the time I managed to catch myself because this mistake hit me later, but not this one. </li>
  <li>Sorry if you were wondering why you can't access the XPStorage's Settings, this one's on me.</li>
 </ul>
