<p>(Also known as the Head Haven mega-update)</p>

<h1>Additions:</h1>
<ul>
 <li>Added <span>3104 new head variants</span>:</li>
 <ul>
  <li>Armadillo Head</li>
  <li>Wolf Heads: Woods, Ashen, Black, Chestnut, Rusty, Spotted, Striped, Snowy.</li>
  <ul>
   <li>This includes their corresponding Angry and <span tabindex=0 class=tooltip><span class=tooltipText>A special variant that contains dog-specific sounds. Has a chance to replace the regular Wolf Head.</span>Dog</span> variants.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Breeze Head</li>
  <li>Bogged Skull, Snipped Bogged Skull</li>
  <li>Sheared Sheep Head</li>
  <li>Noisy variants for Creeper Head, Wither Skeleton Skull, and Dragon Head.</li>
  <ul>
   <li>These variants exist to support more note block sounds for these mobs.</li>
   <li>One doesn't simply fit extra sounds into Vanilla heads ...</li>
  </ul> 
 </ul>
 <li>Added <span>33 new head sounds</span>:</li>
 <ul>
  <li>Armadillo Head (8): All sounds except:</li>
  <ul>
   <li>Landing, Stepping - Not specific enough to armadillos.</li>
   <li>Peeking, Unroll Peek - Is a sequence of sounds, not really a sound.</li>
   <li>Scute Brush - Same sound as Scute Shed.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Parrot Head (2): Breeze, Bogged imitation sounds</li>
  <li>Bogged Head (3): All bogged sounds, <span tabindex=0 class=tooltip><span class=tooltipText>These sounds were not distinct enough.</span>except Step and Shear</span>.</li>
  <li>Breeze Head (12): All breeze sounds, except <span tabindex=0 class=tooltip><span class=tooltipText>This sound was way too quiet.</span>Whirl</span></li>
  <li>Ender Dragon (4): All dragon sounds, except <span tabindex=0 class=tooltip><span class=tooltipText>This was the same as Growl, just different subtitle.</span>Roar</span> and <span tabindex=0 class=tooltip><span class=tooltipText>This is a long sequence of sounds, not really a sound.</span>Death</span>.</li>
  <li>Wither Skeleton (4): All Wither Skeleton sounds.</li>
 </ul>
 <li>You can now <span>transfer sounds between mob heads</span>!</li>
 <ul>
  <li>To do this, get the head's sound by breaking it with a Brush, set it in your offhand, then brush another head with your mainhand to copy the head's sound!</li>
  <li>For this to work, <span>the 2 heads must share the same set of sounds</span>.</li>
  <li>Won't work on Vanilla heads - their sounds can't be tweaked anyway.</li>
 </ul>
 <li><span>New advancement</span>: Something to Brush with ...</li>
 <ul>
  <li>It's a tutorial for the new copy head sounds mechanic.</li>
 </ul>
</ul>

<h1>Changes:</h1>
<ul>
 <li><span>Head texture tweaks</span>:</li>
 <ul>
  <li>The existing Wolf heads: Now looks more consistent with the new variants.</li>
  <ul>
   <li>They also got a new Pale prefix to match the other variants.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Farmer Villager and Zombie Villager heads:</li>
  <ul>
   <li>I tweaked these to give its signature hat some depth, while also try to make it look more like a hat.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Sheep heads:</li>
  <ul>
   <li>The face is now more visible when seen from the front, like it does for the Sheep.</li>
  </ul>
 </ul>
 <li><span tabindex=0 class=tooltip><span class=tooltipText>Also known as drop rate tweaks.</span>Player Kill tweaks</span>:</li>
 <ul>
  <li>The old head variants <span>are now 3x less likely to show up</span> compared to the head variants you'd normally expect.</li>
  <ul>
   <li>Mainly because I want the head you expect a mob to drop is most likely the one you'll get first.</li>
   <li>I also want the old variants to reflect how tricky it is to get access to ancient game knowledge.</li>
  </ul>
  <li><span>Tripled the average amount of Cod and Salmon kills</span> needed to get a head.</li>
  <ul>
   <li>These respawn pretty quickly, and often in schools, so it was much easier to get these than I initially thought they would.</li>
  </ul>
  <li><span>Lowered Tropical Fish head drop rate</span> by 2.5x.</li>
  <ul>
   <li>Same logic with Cod/Salmon heads, but we got a lot more variants for these things.</li>
  </ul>
  <li><span>Raised the amount of kills needed to get a Pufferfish head</span> by 1.45x.</li>
  <ul>
   <li>These don't show up in schools like the others, but getting one was still considered to be a bit too easy.</li>
  </ul>
  <li><span>Dropped Noisy Head variants' replacement rate</span> from 50% to 25%.</li>
  <ul>
   <li>For Wither Skeletons, this is 2.5% due to how valuable it's vanilla counterpart is.</li>
  </ul>
  <li><span tabindex=0 class=tooltip><span class=tooltipText>From 2.1% to 1.8%.</span>Lowered Slime Head rates</span> due to Potion of Oozing.</li>
  <li><span tabindex=0 class=tooltip><span class=tooltipText>From 3.3% to 2.5%.</span>Lowered Silverfish Head rates</span> due to Potion of Infestation.</li>
 </ul>
 <li>Custom Note Block Sound tweaks:</li>
 <ul>
  <li>Heads when brushed <span>now causes block updates</span>, which can be paired with existing Redstone mechanics!</li>
  <li>Now plays the sound the head just switched to if a Note Block is below the head.</li>
  <ul>
   <li>If not, it'll use a custom sound cue.</li>
   <li>This lets you know brushing has worked in cases where particles are too far to be rendered in.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Now cycles through head sounds when brushed continuously!</li>
  <ul>
   <li>This lets you cycle through to your desired sound really quickly, which saves a lot of time.</li>
   <li>It also lets you quickly go through all the possible sounds you just got from that new head of yours.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Raised the chances to get regular Parrot sounds.</li>
  <ul>
   <li>Parrot sounds should always be as likely to show up as the mob imitation sounds.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Now adapts to your current block interaction range!</li>
  <li>Effect colors now have randomization for more variety!</li>
 </ul>
 <li>The old Tropical Fish Head is now called Archaic Tropical Fish Head.</li>
 <ul>
  <li>For <span class=tooltip tabindex=0><span class=tooltipText>Appears 90% of the time, has a special name when put on a Bucket.</span>common Tropical Fishes</span>: This has a 10% chance to replace your expected head variant as the drop.</li>
  <li>It's a good reminder of how annoyed I was having to settle for only one tropical fish head at the time.</li>
 </ul>
 <li>Baby Zombie Villagers <span>no longer drop profession-based heads</span>.</li>
 <ul>
  <li>From the server's view: Zombie Villagers are given random professions when they spawned in, but no exception was made for the babies, even though they're not supposed to have jobs in this universe.</li>
  <li>Unless made visible via a Resource Pack, you normally won't be able to see it, so I tweaked it to be more consistent to what you're actually seeing.</li>
 </ul>
 <li>Head sources <span>now reflect how the head dropped</span>, not how the mob died.</li>
 <ul>
  <li>This means if the drop case is not allowed, it's head source won't be available.</li>
 </ul>
 <li>Fixes and improvements:</li>
 <ul>
  <li>Fixed "Not Behind" advancement not counting if you picked up a Creeper/Piglin Head.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug causing Wither Skeletons to drop only coal instead of coal and bones.</li>
  <li>Improved Wither Boss's head drop processing performance.</li>
 </ul>
 <li>Wither Heads <span>now drop based on Player Kill chance</span> if Wither Kill is the only active setting, instead of being a guaranteed drop.</li>
 <li>Wither Skeleton Skulls now drop based on Player Kill chance if no settings are active, or Wither Kill is the only active setting.</li>
 <ul>
  <li>In previous versions, you get Wither Skeleton Skulls via Charged Creepers if Wither Kill the only head case available, but it's not really that obvious.</li>
  <li>If no settings are active, it's basically vanilla, so Wither Skeleton Skulls should still drop because of that.</li>
 </ul>
 <li>Player Heads' <span>Cause of Death rework</span>:</li>
 <ul>
  <li>Now shows quite a bit more detail on how you died.</li>
  <ul>
   <li>Has the following format: <code>&lttype&gt &ltsource&gt &ltdetails, if any&gt</code></li>
   <li>Can also be Shenanigans if it can't be detected.</li>
  </ul>
  <li><span>Death type</span> can be one of the following:</li>
  <ul>
   <li>Environment kills: Uses a tree icon.</li>
   <li>Player kills: Uses a controller icon.</li>
   <li>Non player kills: Uses a sword icon.</li>
  </ul>
  <li><span>Death source</span>:</li>
  <ul>
   <li>If environment kill: Name of the death environment.</li>
   <ul>
    <li>Supported environments: Cactus, Crammed, Drowned, Exploded, Fireballed, Fireworks, Kinetic Energy, Frozen, On Magma, Suffocated, In Lava, Void, Out of Border, Starved, Withered, On Fire, Fall Damage, Lightning Struck, Falling Block, Sweet Berry Bush</li>
   </ul>
   <li>If player/non player kill: Name of killer.</li>
  </ul>
  <li><span>Death details</span>:</li>
  <ul>
   <li>For direct kills, or if not identified: No details are provided.</li>
   <li>For indirect kills: Shows the kill method's name.</li>
   <ul>
    <li>Supported methods: Sonic Boom, Spat, Thorns, Magic, Arrow, Trident, Wither Skull, Wind Charge, Fireball, Explosion</li>
   </ul>
  </ul>
  <li>This should make storing your death history far more interesting, if you'll even have any.</li>
 </ul>
 <li>Details:</li>
 <ul>
  <li>Changed background to match current game drop's theme.</li>
  <li>Changed Skeleton Shot drop case to Skeleton Kill.</li>
  <ul>
   <li>Bogged and Wither Skeleton kills now count towards the Skeleton Kill head drop case.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Potion Kill has been renamed to Potion Damage.</li>
  <li>Charged Creeper Kill and Creeper Kill have been renamed to Charged Creeper Blast and Creeper Blast respectively.</li>
  <li>Demonic Panda Head has been renamed to Evil Panda Head.</li>
  <ul>
   <li>Now has a 20% chance to replace Aggressive Panda Head (instead of 50%)</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Shellless Shulker Head: Is now 2% + 1% per looting instead of the fixed 5%.</li>
  <li>Pumpkin Mask's name has been removed.</li>
  <li>Rewrote existing setting descriptions:</li>
  <ul>
   <li>Now highlight the more important bits instead of notable subjects.</li>
   <li>Reduced unnecessary differences between cases so you can read through them quicker.</li>
  </ul>
 </ul>
 <li><span tabindex=0 class=tooltip><span class=tooltipText>Hold Ctrl, then press your Pick Block key.</span>Ctrl-Picking</span> now gives you the exact head as the one currently placed.</li>
 <ul>
  <li>Head's sound variant will also be shown as if mined with a Brush.</li>
  <li>Because of this, it's tooltip has been changed from "Brushed Sound" to "Current Sound".</li>
 </ul>
 <li>Editing the head's name via the Anvil now saves the name when it's mined.</li>
 <li>Toast and Rainbow Sheep Heads now drop as long as the name matches, regardless of formatting.</li>
 <li>Decapitation's Head Drop Chances file has been tweaked:</li>
 <ul>
  <li>Is now moved to the Interactive Help File.</li>
  <li>Now shows you all the game's mobs and their head drop chances.</li>
  <li>Also contains how many head variants you can expect to find from this mob.</li>
  <ul>
   <li>Because we got over 3000 head variants now, showing each head's drop rates becomes impractical.</li>
   <li>This approach also won't spoil all the head variants one can expect to find, which makes the whole hunting process much more interesting.</li>
  </ul>
 </ul>

<h1>Admin Settings:</h1>
<ul>
 <li>The in-game settings system has now been reworked, and is now known as Admin Settings.</li>
 <ul>
  <li>You can access these settings by typing <code>/function tdp.config:decapitation</code> in chat.</li>
 </ul>
 <li>Added new Settings:</li>
 <ul>
  <li>Brush Updates: If brushing heads causes block updates.</li>
  <li>Player Head Drops: Enable/Disable Player Head drops.</li>
 </ul>
 <li>Admin Book now saves your current page and loops around, which makes editing easier!</li>
 <li>Added Setting Presets: Save and load your preferences from different worlds, or online!</li>
 <ul>
  <li>This can be found in the Admin Book's Presets page.</li>
 </ul>
</ul>

<h1>Update Notes:</h1>
<ul>
 <li>If you're upgrading from pre-1.21:</li>
 <ul>
  <li>Your existing settings won't be saved to this version because everything was wrecked when 1.20.5 attacked.</li>
  <li>The internal head format has also been wrecked when 1.20.5 attacked, so that had to be reworked.</li>
  <ul>
   <li>You can migrate heads from the old format to the new one by changing it's Note Block Sound.</li>
   <li>Existing Note Block head sounds aren't affected, so your contraptions will still work just fine.</li>
  </ul>
 </ul>
</ul>

<h1>Extras:</h1>
<ul>
 <li>After 6 years of making datapacks, we finally have icons now!</li>
 <li>Improved the look of info text messages.</li>
 <li>Text files have been merged into one single Interactive Help File.</li>
 <ul>
  <li>I have to learn 3 new languages to get all this to work as well as it did.</li>
  <li>Not the best at it yet, but it works well enough for now.</li>
 </ul>
 <li>Codebase now uses Scripter 4.</li>
</ul>
