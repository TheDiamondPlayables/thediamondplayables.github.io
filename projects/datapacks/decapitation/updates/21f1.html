<h1>Changes:</h1>
<ul>
 <li>Is now designed for 1.21.6! (Ported from Version 21e1.)</li>
 <li>Added new heads: Ghastling, Happy Ghast</li>
 <ul>
  <li>Happy Ghasts <span>have a 35% chance of dropping the Ghastling head</span> instead of it's head.</li>
  <ul>
   <li>This is mainly to avoid making you kill babies in order to get Ghastling heads.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>If the Happy Ghast was killed with fire and a head would've dropped, Dried Ghast is dropped instead.</li>
 </ul>
 <li>Added <span>9 new sounds</span>:</li>
 <ul>
  <li>Ghastling (4): All available sounds.</li>
  <li>Happy Ghast (5): All except Equip, Unequip and Riding.</li>
  <ul>
   <li>The first 2 are strictly Harness sounds, and the last one has no sound attached.</li>
  </ul>
 </ul>
 <li>Updated the Ghast head texture to match the new version.</li>
 <ul>
  <li>The old one is now known as the Old Ghast Head and has a 25% chance to replace the Ghast Head drop.</li>
 </ul>
 <li>Changed background and icon to match current game drop's theme.</li>
</ul>
