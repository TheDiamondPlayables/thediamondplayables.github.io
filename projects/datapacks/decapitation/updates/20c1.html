<h1>Changes:</h1>
<ul>
 <li>Is now designed for Minecraft 1.20.3 and 1.20.4!</li>
 <li>Updated the Bat Head to reflect the updated Bat model introduced in 1.20.3!</li>
 <ul>
  <li>The old Bat Head is still available and is now called the Old Bat Head instead.</li>
 </ul>
</ul>

<h1>Excel File Tweaks:</h1>
<ul>
 <li>Fixed a lot of small errors scattered about in the Decapitation Heads excel file.</li>
 <ul>
  <li>All icon scaling issues have now been fixed.</li>
  <li>All drop rate calculation inconsistencies have also been fixed.</li>
 </ul>
 <li>Merged some empty cells for a cleaner look.</li>
 <ul>
  <li>Also, texts from some title and header cells have also been tweaked.</li>
 </ul>
 <li>All "Yes" values are now emotes.</li>
 <li>All drop rate numbers are now rounded to two decimal places.</li>
 <ul>
  <li>Yeah, you don't really need all the extra decimals at the end - it's too small to have any impacts.</li>
 </ul>
 <li>Added data for the Bat Head and tweaked the drop rates accordingly.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Notes:</h1>
<ul>
 <li>I've also got all my internal systems ready for the upcoming mega-update that's adding 3072 Tropical Fish Heads to this project.</li>
 <ul>
  <li>They aren't currently used in the update, but I'll put that to good use pretty soon!</li>
 </ul>
 <li>If you want to help me add 3072 Tropical Fish Head Variants to the game, I need you to help me with designing the skins for only 12 of them.</li>
 <ul>
  <li>I have the underlying systems all ready for this mega-update, but I'll need your help to do these head variants some justice.</li>
 </ul>
 <li>You can also help me maintain projects like this by <a href="https://thediamondplayables.com/donate">helping me on Patreon</a>!</li>
 <ul>
  <li>Your money will go into maintaining my projects, and expand them with better features and mechanics!</li>
  <li>It'll also go into making bigger and better mega-releases, too!</li>
 </ul>
</ul>
