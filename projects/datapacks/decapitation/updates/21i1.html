<h1>Changes:</h1>
<ul>
 <li>Is now designed for 1.21.9 and 1.21.10! (Ported from Version 21g1.)</li>
 <li>Added <span>8 new heads for the Copper Golem</span>!</li>
 <ul>
  <li>These heads are more Pumpkin than they are Copper, so <span>they won't act like Copper Blocks</span>.</li>
  <li>They're also not complete Pumpkin, so you can't use them to resurrect the Copper Golem.</li>
 </ul>
 <li>Added <span>new sounds for the Copper Golem heads</span>!</li>
 <li><span>Charged Creeper head source improvements</span>:</li>
 <ul>
  <li>Turning off Charged Creeper head drop case now works on mobs that drop vanilla heads!</li>
  <li>Noisy variants of Vanilla Heads can now be obtained under the Charged Creeper source!</li>
  <li>Charged Creepers now drop Charged Creeper Head if killed by a Charged Creeper!</li>
  <li>I would've done these before, if Charged Creeper drops weren't hardcoded back then.</li>
 </ul>
 <li>Changed background and icon to match current game drop's theme.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Developer's Comments:</h1>
<ul>
 <li>I'd experimented with making the Copper Golem Heads <span tabindex=0 class=tooltip><span class=tooltipText style="right: 0;">Oxidizing normally, can be waxed and scraped.</span>act more like Copper</span>, but I found that what the change ultimately did is that it asks more processing power from the game in order to make what would otherwise be 8 distinctive heads feel like they're just 1 head.</li>
 <li>So to preserve the heads' collectible value, these heads will be the sole exception when it comes to Copper stuff.</li>
 <ul>
  <li>Think of the heads as being more Pumpkin than Copper - I mean, you made them with a Pumpkin, there still has to be some of it in them somewhere, right?</li>
 </ul>
