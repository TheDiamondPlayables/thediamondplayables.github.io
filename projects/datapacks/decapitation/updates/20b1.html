<h1>Changes:</h1>
<ul>
 <li>Is now designed for Minecraft 1.20.2!</li>
 <li>Improved Decapitation's Heads format!</li>
 <ul>
  <li>The new format is now designed for 1.20.2, and is a bit more lightweight as well!</li>
 </ul>
 <li>To update old heads to this format: Mine the affected heads and they'll update immediately.</li>
 <ul>
  <li>The updated old heads still stacks with the heads made with the new format.</li>
 </ul>
 <li>Player Heads that newly dropped can't be stacked with those mined after placing down.</li>
 <ul>
  <li>This is an unwanted side effect and will be fixed if I could think of a lightweight solution.</li>
 </ul>
 <li>Decapitation's Advancement Icon is now a Sniffer Head.</li>
 <ul>
  <li>I forgot to update the Advancement Icon for 1.20, so I'm doing that now.</li>
 </ul>
 <li>Fixed <code>tdp.511:all_heads</code> debug function.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Modders' Notes:</h1>
<ul>
 <li>All heads' internal data have been updated to use the new Decapitation's Heads format.</li>
</ul>
