<h1>Changes:</h1>
<ul>
 <li>Is now designed for Minecraft 1.21.5! (Ported from Version 21d1.)</li>
 <li>Added Cold and Warm variants for Cow, Chicken and Pig Heads!</li>
 <ul>
  <li>These heads have the same sound set as the default Heads.</li>
  <li>Also, no, the classic heads won't have the Temperate prefix.</li>
 </ul>
 <li>Updated the following heads to better match the game's updated models:</li>
 <ul>
  <li>Cow Head</li>
  <li>Red Mooshroom Head, Brown Mooshroom Head</li>
  <li>Pig Head</li>
  <li>Chicken Head </li>
  <li>Because these are really close to the original textures, I've opted not to have an Old variant for them.</li>
 </ul>
 <li>Added all the new wolf sounds to Wolf Heads!</li>
 <li>Wolf Head Sound tweaks:</li>
 <ul>
  <li>All wolf heads now share the Shake, Hurt and Death sounds.</li>
  <ul>
   <li>Shake is more likely to show up for Dog Heads and less likely for Angry Heads.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Other sounds used by the head variants:</li>
  <ul>
   <li>Regular: Woof</li>
   <li>Dog: <span tabindex=0 class=tooltip><span class=tooltipText>Previously called Sad, but we got a Sad wolf sound variant now</span>Whine</span>, Pant</li>
   <li>Angry: Growl</li>
   <li>These sounds are more likely to show up compared to the shared sounds.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>All vanilla sound variants have been added.</li>
  <li><span>The "Howl" sound has been removed</span> because it was removed by the game.</li>
  <li>The new changes only apply when you're modifying the sounds.</li>
  <ul>
   <li>Your existing mob head sound contraptions still works as they did, unless the block was mined, got brushed, or you used the Howl sound.</li>
  </ul>
 </ul>
 <li>Reworked Tropical Fish head variant detection algorithm using new update's mechanics.</li>
 <ul>
  <li>These head variants are now accurate even if the fish died instantly after spawning in.</li>
 </ul>
 <li><span>Player Heads now stack together</span> if their Cause of Death looks similar enough.</li>
 <ul>
  <li>These items are now also stored more efficiently, which'll help if you have a lot of these.</li>
 </ul>
 <li>Changed background and icon to match current game drop's theme.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Update Notes:</h1>
<ul>
 <li>If you're using Decapitation from Branch 21-x to 21dx before this update, uninstall said branch first before updating!</li>
 <ul>
  <li>This'll remove the extra Tropical Fish storage data that's no longer used in this version.</li>
  <li>If you have modified settings: Save it in a Preset first, so you can load it again after the update!</li>
 </ul>
</ul>
