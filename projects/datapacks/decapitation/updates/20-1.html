<p>(Also known as the "Heads of the Past" mega-update)</p>
<p>The "Heads of the Past" Mega Update is finally out now, with a huge overhaul towards how mobheads work to better compliment the new Mob Head Sounds mechanic introduced in Minecraft 1.20, new head variants, reworked head drop rates, and more tools to find how many heads you've found so far!</p>

<h1>Important Note:</h1>
<ul>
 <li>If you have Merchant or Fishing Extended, you'll need to update those 2 as well to avoid Pack Clashing.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Additions:</h1>
<ul>
 <li>Mobheads now play sounds when used on a Note Block!</li>
 <li>Brushing a new mobhead now changes the sound that mob plays above a Noteblock!</li>
 <ul>
  <li>Note that each head variant has its own set of possible head sounds.</li>
  <li>The head itself should give you a hint on which head sounds it has.</li>
  <li>Due to game limitations, this doesn't work on mobheads made before v20-1, or vanilla mobheads.</li>
 </ul>
 <li>Move a head with its sound by breaking it with the Brush!</li>
 <ul>
  <li>You can also inspect the sound the head makes this way, too!</li>
 </ul>
 <li>Mobheads now have extra attributes to show where you've got it.</li>
 <ul>
  <li>This mainly serves to separate Heads collected between different methods.</li>
  <li>Mainly because some methods are harder to collect than others.</li>
 </ul>
 <li>Added new heads:</li>
 <ul>
  <li>Screaming Goat Head.</li>
  <li>A "Noisy" variant to Zombie Head and Skeleton Skull.</li>
  <li>Camel Head.</li>
  <li>Sniffer Head.</li>
 </ul>
 <li><span tabindex=0 class=tooltip><span class=tooltipText>Hold Ctrl, then press your Pick Block key</span>Ctrl-Picking</span> now tries harder to emulate the old mob head's name.</li>
 <ul>
  <li>This is a hardcoded game action though - I can only emulate it as hard as I can.</li>
  <li>You can still break the mobhead by any indirect means in Creative to get the original head back.</li>
 </ul>
 <li>New Advancements:</li>
 <ul>
  <li><span>Noteworthy Dustoff</span>: Brush a head to change it's sound!</li>
  <li><span>What's that sound?</span>: Break a brushed head with a Brush to find out!</li>
 </ul>
 <li>Added a new Available Heads Excel file!</li>
 <ul>
  <li>The file is made with Excel, so you'd need Excel or something compatible to open it.</li>
  <li>Here's hoping your spreadsheet viewer/editor supports Filters, cause you're gonna need em.</li>
 </ul>
</ul>

<h1>Changes:</h1>
<ul>
 <li>Updated Decapitation Head Format.</li>
 <ul>
  <li>Had to do this to add new features to the Heads themselves.</li>
  <li>It still works with heads from the old format though!</li>
 </ul>
 <li>New heads dropped no longer plays a sound.</li>
 <ul>
  <li>Mainly so these heads can stack together again without issue.</li>
 </ul>
 <li>Lowered heads' drop chance for "Player Kill" condition.</li>
 <ul>
  <li>This is to make getting these heads feel more like a goal to work towards for this setting.</li>
  <li>New drop rates available in Player Kill Drop Chances text file.</li>
 </ul>
 <li>Updated Piglin Head to use the Vanilla one instead.</li>
 <ul>
  <li>The old Piglin Head is now Old Piglin Head instead.</li>
 </ul>
 <li>Changed the Description for the "Not Behind" achievement.</li>
 <li>Cleaned up outdated lines in "Installing Decapitation" text file.</li>
</ul>
