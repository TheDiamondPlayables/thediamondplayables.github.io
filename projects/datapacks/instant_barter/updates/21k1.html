<p>After a while of having to deal with landmines that came with Mounts of Mayhem, the Datapack Series are finally here for the last game drop of 2025!</p>

<h1>Changes:</h1>
<ul>
 <li>Is now designed for Minecraft 1.21.11!</li>
 <li>Updated advancement background to match game update's theme.</li>
</ul>

<p>PS: I release the entire Series at once each time I bring it to a new game drop, so if you only use some of my packs you won't be able to tell why it took me this long to bring them up to the latest release.
<br>Just something to think about, I guess.</p>
